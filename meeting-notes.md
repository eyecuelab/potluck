	Oregon Food Bank ~15% of total
	Birch Community Services ~80$ of total
	- Chicken
	- Salad
	- ...
- Saturday: Pickup continued (Driver and Gleaner(s))
	- Starbucks
	- Trader Joes
	- New Seasons
	- Albertsons
	- Dave’s Killer Bread
- Saturday: Prep and meal plan (Chef onsite)
-----------------------------------------
- Sometimes certain pickups don’t happen because volunteers aren’t available.
- Lack of storage space is an issue.
- Sometimes storage space is borrowed from other groups, feast or famine w/regards to donations.
- No accountability, things go missing
- Runnner needs accountability?
- Need for locks on freezers and fridges.
- ‘Storing’ happens in 2 stages:
	- Initial sorting: What has come in.
	- Saturday sort/store: 2nd pass
- 3/4 sorters have smart phones
- Barbara moves stuff around to ‘make space’ (Helpful or unhelpful?)
- Admin needs to print a list of all inventory
- Inventory will justify freezer request etc.
- Health Inspector requirements(can the inventory app help?)

GF 4/22

#Site visit: Goose Hollow Kitchen
- Storage areas blend into each other, sometimes things are stored in non-conventional area.
- Freezers are marked, shelving is unique for each one.
- Mixed boxes are the norm, a box of 'pork' could mean a box with several pork items plus some bacon and big slab of beef etc.
- Super nice folks.
- Storage is largely in 5(or more?) rooms/spaces
- Each space has a mix of shelves, cupboards, freezers, fridges etc.
- Adopting their language for locations to some extent
- Seems like sorting is half ass, until the menu is planned and then boxes are sorted to meet the demands of the menu.
- How to incentiveise early sorting. How to make resorting after the weekend happen?
- Lots of potential for inventory to walk off and very little motivation to change that.
- Does each level of the tree have an "all of the above"/"misc. protien"/"fridge somewhere"/"room somewhere"?
