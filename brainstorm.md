###Potluck in the Park
##Potluck
###Basics
1. What are the main problems/issues that you want this app to solve?
2. Which problem(s) are of the most importance?
3. Who are the main users of this app?
4. What sort of devices are you imagining this app running on?
5. What features do you already have in mind?
6. Have you come across any examples of apps or systems that would partially solve problems

###Food Safety/Expiration:
1. What are the rules for how food must be dated/marked?
2. Can you provide us with the rules for how long food can be served? e.g. expiration rules.
3. Can you provide us with the rules for where food can be stored? e.g. no meat above vegetables.
4. Does the state that food is picked up in dictate when it must be used? e.g frozen vs. thawed.
5. Do you have any current system to handle these rules?
6. Do you mark what things are and when they need to be used by with labels/other?
7. How would you feel abut a label system?

###Food Use
1. Are there other ways that food goes out the door other than being prepared or discarded by a chef?
2. Does a lot of food go missing? Is this an issue?
3. Do you have a need for tracking food use?


###Secondary:
1. Value in knowing what was used and how? e.g the bread donated on October 12th was used to make thanksgiving stuffing. Eaten vs. spoiled knowledge.
2. Value in knowing what the chefs would like to have in the pantry? E.g. “Chef Rick wants Cinnamon”
3. Value in documenting the menu for a given week?
4. Value in seeing what was donated/used over time?



###Categories:
1. Produce: Use quickly, oldest first?  Is some produce OK in freezer? Does different produce have different rate of expiration?
2. Protein: Can be frozen. Must be thawed. Oldest first. Does the state of the protein when donated affect its use.
3. Spices: Chef: What spices do we have? “Have” vs. “Want/Need” vs. “None”.
4. Staples: e.g. Cooking oils, maybe spices, S & P,
5. Non-perishables: Is this a category?
6. Non-allowed foods e.g home canned
7. What other categories make sense?
