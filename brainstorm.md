Potluck
##Basics
- What are the main problems/issues that you want this app to solve?
- Which problem(s) are of the most importance?
- Who are the main users of this app?
- What sort of devices are you imagining this app running on?
- What features do you already have in mind?
- Have you come across any examples of apps or systems that would partially solve problems

###Food Safety/Expiration:
- What are the rules for how food must be dated/marked?
- Can you provide us with the rules for how long food can be served? e.g. expiration rules.
- Can you provide us with the rules for where food can be stored? e.g. no meat above vegetables.
- Does the state that food is picked up in dictate when it must be used? e.g frozen vs. thawed.
- Do you have any current system to handle these rules?
- Do you mark what things are and when they need to be used by with labels/other?
- How would you feel abut a label system?

###Food Use
- Are there other ways that food goes out the door other tan being prepared or discarded by a chef? 
- Does a lot of food go missing? Is this an issue?
- Do you have a need for tracking food use?
	

###Secondary:
- Value in knowing what was used and how? e.g the bread donated on October 12th was used to make thanksgiving stuffing. Eaten vs. spoiled knowledge.
- Value in knowing what the chefs would like to have in the pantry? E.g. “Chef Rick wants Cinnamon”
	

##Categories:
- Produce: Use quickly, oldest first?  Is some produce OK in freezer? Does different produce have different rate of expiration?
- Protein: Can be frozen. Must be thawed. Oldest first. Does the state of the protein when donated affect its use.
- Spices: Chef: What spices do we have? “Have” vs. “Want/Need” vs. “None”. 
- Staples: e.g. Cooking oils, maybe spices, S & P, 
- Non-perishables: Is this a category?
- Non-allowed foods e.g home canned
- What other categories make sense?
