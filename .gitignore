# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle
/rails/.bundle

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
/rails/log/*
!/log/.keep
!/rails/log/.keep

/tmp
/rails/tmp
.DS-store
/rails/.DS-store
